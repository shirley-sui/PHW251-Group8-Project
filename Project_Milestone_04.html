<p>COVID vaccination rate vs flu rate interpretation: Analysis of the COVID vaccination rate data and simulated flu data indicates that COVID vaccination does not seem to strongly reflect flu vaccination within the 57 California counties from which data was collected/simulated. Additional measures to promote flu vaccination may be needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify where there is any correlation between COVID vaccination rates on flu rates and/or severity.</li>

<p>Correlation table interpretation: Correlation values per each case provide insights into the relationships between COVID vaccination rates and severe flu cases rates in different scenarios, ranging from weak negative to moderate positive correlations. There is a significant weak negative correlation between the high vaccination rate group and low severe flu rate which might be impacted by confounders.</p>
