<p>** NOTE: I just pasted all of our interpretations here - it should be modified to flow better and maybe provide more context. Some of this might belong more in the Results section, too**</p>
<p>It’s crucial to recognize that this analysis pertains to aggregate-level data, and caution should be exercised in generalizing these findings to individual-level dynamics to avoid the ecological fallacy.</p>
<p>Analysis of the COVID vaccination rate data and simulated flu data indicates that COVID vaccination does not seem to strongly reflect flu vaccination within the 57 California counties from which data was collected/simulated. Additional measures to promote flu vaccination may be needed.</p>
<p>Correlation values per each case provide insights into the relationships between COVID vaccination rates and severe flu cases rates in different scenarios, ranging from weak negative to moderate positive correlations. There is a significant weak negative correlation between the high vaccination rate group and low severe flu rate which might be impacted by confounders.</p>
<p>COVID vaccination versus flu severity by age group interpretation: The data indicates an age-related uptrend in vaccination rates among the older demographics. Intriguingly, despite heightened vaccination coverage in these age groups, there is a simultaneous upswing in average flu severity.</p>
