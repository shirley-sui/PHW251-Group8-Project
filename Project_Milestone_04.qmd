## Project Milestone #4: Visualizations

Submit an Rmd or Qmd and publish an html file on RPubs with the following:

## Final datasets for creation of visualization

```{r load libraries, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(tidy.opts = list(width.cutoff = 60), tidy = TRUE)

# Load tidyverse for all data cleaning packages
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
```

```{r load dataset}
#Load data from project Milestone #3 in Milestone_3_Clean_Data
df_vax <- read_csv('./Milestone_3_Clean_Data/df_ca_vax_clean_subset.csv')
df_flu <- read_csv('./Milestone_3_Clean_Data/df_flu_clean_aggregate.csv')
```

-   Join all datasets together
-   Calculate any remaining data elements needed for analysis
-   Show code used to create joined dataset, but please do not print full data frame output (showing data structure with str() is okay)

```{r Join all datasets together}
# Flu data only has quarters 2022.4 to 2023.2
# Vax data has quarters 2022.1 to 2023.3
# Before joining, filter vax data to only 2022.4 to 2023.2

df_vax <- df_vax %>%
  filter(quarter >= 2022.4 & quarter <= 2023.2)

# perform inner_join - we don't want any data that doesn't have a match in both datasets

df_joined <- inner_join(df_flu, df_vax, by = join_by(age_category, county, quarter)) %>% select(!c(sum_dx_new, sum_severe_new)) %>% drop_na()

# show data structure
str(df_joined)
```
## Visualizations (at least one per group member)

-   One print quality table as requested in scenario
-   One print quality plot or chart as requested in scenario
-   For groups of 3, one additional print quality table or plot of your choice (can support the requested data in the scenario, or answer a different question using the same data sources)

<<<<<<< HEAD
#### Research Question(s)
-   Identify if COVID vaccination rates reflect flu vaccination rates in populations and or if more should be done to encourage flu vaccinations --- face wrap by county, line plot (one vax one new flu cases) [Shirley]
-   Identify where there is any correlation between COVID vaccination rates on flu rates and/or severity. --- data table? 2x2 (low/high vax vs low/high flu) [Kim]
-   age group vax vs flu severity [Nicole]

```{Correlation table indicating relationship between COVID vaccination rates on severe flu rate - Kim}

summary(df_joined)

# Create categories based on COVID vaccination rates and severe flu rates

    Severe_Flu_Rate = ifelse(severe_new_rate <= median(severe_new_rate), "Low Severe Flu Rate (Min = 0.00)", "High Severe Flu Rate (Max = 0.43)")

# Calculate the correlation for each combination
correlation_table <- data %>%
  group_by(COVID_Vaccination_Rate, Severe_Flu_Rate) %>%

# Rename columns

# Print the correlation table with kableExtra
correlation_table %>%

    format = "html", 
    caption = "Correlation between COVID vaccination rates and severity of flu rate, 2022-2023", align = "c"

  kable_styling(
    full_width = FALSE,
    position = "center",
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"),
    latex_options = "striped"
  ) %>%

  # Print the result
print(correlation_table)
```
INTREPRETATION:

-  Correlation table interpretation: Correlation values per each case provide insights into the relationships between COVID vaccination rates and severe flu cases rates in different scenarios, ranging from weak negative to moderate positive correlations.

## For each visual, include - Code used to generate visual - Legend (if necessary) - 1-2 sentence interpretation

NOTE: Please make sure the visual can stand-alone, meaning it includes enough information in title, legend, and footnote so that a person who sees only the visualization could understand what is being presented. Please also make sure column names, axis labels, and any other labels are meaningful and not just the name of the variable (ex: "County" rather than "county_name")




## Html file that is professionally prepared for presentation and published to RPubs

-   Only the necessary information is in the output (e.g., suppress entire data frame outputs but showing data structure with str() is okay.
-   Code used to import and clean data (milestones 2 and 3) can be included in the rmd/qmd but please use the option include=FALSE in order to prevent the code and any output from. Code chunk would look like {r chunk_name, include=FALSE}
-   Utilize warning=FALSE and message=FALSE to suppress any warnings/messages that may be displaying from any chunks
-   For this milestone please make sure code for visualizations are included in the final file. - Show your work by "echoing" code used in Rmd/Qmd file to create your tables and graphs. \`\`\`{r, echo = TRUE} in code chunk preferences.
-   Use headers and sub headers to create an organized document \## Running Code
